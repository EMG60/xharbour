Lots of Visual xHarbour debugger TODOs:

EXECUTION:
- Animate
- Run to cursor
- Watchpoints / Tracepoints

MONITOR:
- Change variable values from Monitor
+ MEMVAR monitoring
- GLOBAL monitoring
- Array monitoring
- Hash monitoring
- Object monitoring

MISC:
- Expression evaluation
+ Callstack walking
- Set() browsing
- Work area browsing
- GUI humanization
- Command window
- CLD command set compatibility?

VXH ITSELF:
- Force rebuilding clean with debug info switched on/off
- Save "Build with debugging info" property
- Kill the program being debugged on exit
+ Set breakpoints in the editor (file name retrieval)
+ Set breakpoints in the editor (visual breakpoint mark)
- Set breakpoints only on valid breakpoint lines
- Make VXH work as a debugging client for non-VXH / remote programs?
- Work as a standalone debugger (VXH separation)

WHAT ELSE?
