IMAGE_SCN_LNK_NRELOC_OVFL indicates that the count of relocations for the section
exceeds the 16 bits reserved for it in section header. If the bit is set and the
NumberOfRelocations field in the section header is 0xffff, the actual relocation
count is stored in the 32-bit VirtualAddress field of the first relocation.








weak extern hanteras nog lite fel av länkaren:

Assume that there is a weak extern for "var" with a default resolution
name of "con". If there is a PUBDEF for "var" in some library module that
would not otherwise be linked in, then the library module is not linked
in, and any references to "var" are resolved to "con". However, if the
library module is linked in for other reasons (for example, to resolve
references to a strong extern named "bletch") then "var" will be resolved
by the PUBDEF from the library, not to the default resolution "con".

WKEXTs are best understood by explaining why they were added in the first
place. The minimum BASIC run-time library in the past consisted of a large
amount of code that was always linked in, even for the smallest program.
Most of this code was never called directly by the user, but it was called
indirectly from other routines in other libraries, so it had to be linked
in to resolve the external references.

For instance, the floating-point library was linked in even if the user's
program did not use floating-point operations, because the PRINT library
routine contained calls to the floating-point library for support to print
floating-point numbers.

The solution was to make the function calls between the libraries into weak
externals, with the default resolution set to a small stub routine. If the
user never used a language construct or feature that needed the additional
library support, then no strong extern would be generated by the compiler
and the default resolution (to the stub routine) would be used. However,
if the user accessed the library's routines or used constructs that required
the library's support, a strong extern would be generated by the compiler
to cancel the effect of the weak extern, and the library module would be
linked in. This required that the compiler know a lot about which libraries
are needed for which constructs, but the resulting executable was much
smaller.

Note:
The construct in Microsoft MASM 6.0 that produces a weak extern is
EXTERN var(con): byte which makes "con" the default resolution for weak
extern "var".
